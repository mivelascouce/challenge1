My Profile

My name is Mateo Velasco, I am 25 and this is my first work experience in a software development company. First, I want to thank the opportunity, I'm going to give all of me, I come here to learn and contribute with everything I can.
About my programming experience, I know languages like Java, Python, Javascript, Matlab, C++, some of .NET, but my two favorite languages are Java and Python. I did my internships in Complex Systems Modeling Group in Central University of Ecuador, there I did a Python project about the protected areas and the goal was identify if inside of this areas there were invasion attempts using satellite images. This projecte was recognized in Central University and I was invited to a congress at the National Polytechnic University about projects for environmental care. Unfortunately, it could not be completed because there was no money to finance.
Also, I did my thesis in Python too, the objective was to predcit the election results in 2021 in the first round using Twitter and IA. The results were incredible, we had more precision in the percentages to each candidate than other pollsters like Exit Poll or Cedatos. Actually, I am in titulation process to be Computer Engineer 
In Java I worked in some little projects inside the subjects of the University, also the use of commands in Linux terminal.
I am currently develping a website for mi uncle's company using Wordpress and another little jobs for some friends in many languages. I like to learn always new things and new technologies. 

In this challenge I could learn some new technologies like Docker, Lando, Drupal and Github, it was really fun!
